# Format preserving Encryption with the Vault Transform Secrets Engine
This demo shows how to use the Transform secrets engine to encrypt data while preserving data formatting.

Note: This demo uses Vault Enterprise 1.4, Vault Enterprise in trial mode is limited to sessions of 30 minutes before the Vault server will enter sealed state. You will need to restart the server to reactivate the trial.

## Requirements:
* Docker []()
* Shipyard [https://shipyard.run/docs/install](https://shipyard.run/docs/install)

```json
{
  "card_number": "1234-1234-1234-1234",
  "expiration": "0423",
  "cv2": "123"
}

```

## Running the demo
The demo uses Shipyard to start a Vault server and example application in Docker on your local machine. To run the demo use the following command:

```shell
‚ûú shipyard run ./blueprint 
Running configuration from:  ./blueprint

2020-06-02T07:10:00.191+0100 [INFO]  Creating Network: ref=local
```

Once started interactive documentation can be run for the demo at [http://docs.docs.shipyard.run:8080/docs/index](http://docs.docs.shipyard.run:8080/docs/index). The Vault server, Postgres server and example applications are also accessible from your terminal at the following locations:

* Vault `localhost:8200`
* PostgreSQL `localhost:5432` DB: `payments`, User: `root`, Pass: `password`
* Java example application `localhost:9092`
* Go example application  `localhost:9091`

## Stopping the demo
To stop the demo and clean up resources, run the following command:

```shell
demo-vault/transform on ÓÇ† master [!] via üêπ v1.13.8 on üê≥ v19.03.10 () 
‚ûú shipyard destroy
